# Git Push After Changes

After completing any request that results in file changes (edits, additions, deletions):

1. Run `git add .` to stage all changes
2. Run `git commit -m "descriptive message"` with a short message describing the changes
3. Run `git push origin main` to push to the remote repository

Remote: https://github.com/Bilal-Asif-1/JustChocola8.git  
Branch: main

Do this at the end of the same turn, before responding to the user.
